It’s quite unfortunate that one of the few programming languages familiar and accessible to non-developers and marketers at work is based on technology from decades ago.\nCompared to today’s technologies, it might be natural that it shows its limitations. Today, I’m attempting a workaround to implement a mouse hover effect on an object used as a button.\nTake #2 # Create image pairs for default and hover states. Since changing colors later requires regenerating all images, you need to choose carefully. Overlay the two images: place the hover image on top with its Visible property set to False, and the default image underneath.\nThen, place a transparent label covering the entire page background. Using the MouseMove event on the default image, set the hover image’s Visible to True on mouse over.\nFinally, use the MouseMove event on the transparent label to set the hover image’s Visible back to False when the mouse moves away.\nTake #3 # VBA code snippets\nsub code() msgbox \u0026#34;This code will be ready to show soon\u0026#34; end sub → original post(from my Kor blog) : https://sunnybong.tistory.com/921\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/posts/002/","title":"MacroToolkit(PowerPoint)","section":"Posts","content":" What is it? # Since PowerPoint often requires manual work tailored to each specific scenario, it’s harder to create standardized features compared to Excel.

Although these were personal macros, I once shared them publicly hoping they might help others. However, whether offered for free or as paid tools, they never gained much traction, so I eventually withdrew all of them.\nKey Point # The main value lies not so much in any individual feature, but in gathering various macros into one place for easier management. To handle this, I used a UserForm, but surprisingly, the VB6 UserForm is quite outdated and lacks many features that we now take for granted—like support for PNG images, for example.\n→ Nonetheless, it serves well enough for organizing the macros.\nWhat I Learned # Somehow, I ended up accumulating knowledge more about peripheral topics than about the core of VBA itself.\n→ I looked into evilClippy because I was embarrassed to expose my code publicly.\n→ I explored xlwings for editing VBA code directly in VSCode.\nDownload # To keep track of versions, I’ve stored the files at the following location:\nv0.32\nhttps://naver.me/5jBY9gto\n→ original post(from my Kor blog) : https://sunnybong.tistory.com/874\n"}]
