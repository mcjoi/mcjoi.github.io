However, uploading images online for conversion every time is a bit inconvenient, and using Photoshop for this is also not ideal.\nI downloaded a conversion program from the Google Dev site, but it requires entering commands in the CMD each time. This is also tedious, so I decided to create a simple Python program. I set up the program as shown below, making sure that Python is added to the Windows PATH so it can be run from anywhere.\npython.py ← The Python script file\n└── libwebp-1.4.0-windows-x64 ← Folder containing the WebP library\nBy placing a batch file on the desktop (or anywhere else), you can easily execute the Python program. Just make sure the required Python packages are installed in advance.\nWhen you run it, the first file explorer window will let you select the file you want to convert, and the second will let you choose the folder where the converted file will be saved. Of course, you can also tweak the code to fix the target folder to any location you prefer.\nsample code # import os import tkinter from tkinter import filedialog from PIL import Image from PIL.ExifTags import TAGS def get_image_width(image_path): # Open the image with Image.open(image_path) as img: # Get the width return img.width if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: # 폴더선택 root = tkinter.Tk() root.withdraw() file_path = filedialog.askopenfilenames( parent=root, initialdir=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, title=\u0026#39;Please select target files\u0026#39;) # 대상파일선택 dir_path = filedialog.askdirectory( parent=root, initialdir=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, title=\u0026#39;Please select saving directory\u0026#39;) # 저장폴더선택 programPath = os.getcwd() + \u0026#34;/libwebp-1.4.0-windows-x64/bin/cwebp.exe\u0026#34; # 프로그램저장경로(수정!!!) for fileConvertion in file_path : filename = os.path.basename(fileConvertion) name, extension = os.path.splitext(filename, ) # Example usage image_path = fileConvertion print(image_path) width = get_image_width(image_path) print(f\u0026#34;Image width: {width}\u0026#34;) if width \u0026gt; 700 : command = programPath + \u0026#39; \u0026#34;\u0026#39; + fileConvertion + \u0026#39;\u0026#34; -q 100 -resize 700 0 -o \u0026#34;\u0026#39; + dir_path + \u0026#39;/\u0026#39; + name + \u0026#39;.webp\u0026#34;\u0026#39; print(command) else : command = programPath + \u0026#39; \u0026#34;\u0026#39; + fileConvertion + \u0026#39;\u0026#34; -q 100 -o \u0026#34;\u0026#39; + dir_path + \u0026#39;/\u0026#39; + name + \u0026#39;.webp\u0026#34;\u0026#39; os.system(command=command) result # Because the size was also converted, the file size is greatly reduced. original post (Kor) "},{"id":1,"href":"/vba/03001/","title":"Hover effect","section":"VBA","content":" Creating mouse hover effect in excel VBA userform # Take #1 # When did VB6—the foundation of VBA—officially lose technical support?
