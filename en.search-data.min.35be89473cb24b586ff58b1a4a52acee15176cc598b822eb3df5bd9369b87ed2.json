Although these were personal macros, I once shared them publicly hoping they might help others. However, whether offered for free or as paid tools, they never gained much traction, so I eventually withdrew all of them.\nKey Point # The main value lies not so much in any individual feature, but in gathering various macros into one place for easier management. To handle this, I used a UserForm, but surprisingly, the VB6 UserForm is quite outdated and lacks many features that we now take for granted—like support for PNG images, for example.\n→ Nonetheless, it serves well enough for organizing the macros.\nWhat I Learned # Somehow, I ended up accumulating knowledge more about peripheral topics than about the core of VBA itself.\n→ I looked into evilClippy because I was embarrassed to expose my code publicly.\n→ I explored xlwings for editing VBA code directly in VSCode.\nDownload # To keep track of versions, I’ve stored the files at the following location:\nv0.32\nhttps://naver.me/5jBY9gto\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/posts/002/","title":"MacroToolkit(PowerPoint)","section":"Posts","content":" What is it? # Since PowerPoint often requires manual work tailored to each specific scenario, it’s harder to create standardized features compared to Excel.
