It’s quite unfortunate that one of the few programming languages familiar and accessible to non-developers and marketers at work is based on technology from decades ago.\nCompared to today’s technologies, it might be natural that it shows its limitations. Today, I’m attempting a workaround to implement a mouse hover effect on an object used as a button.\nTake #2 # Create image pairs for default and hover states. Since changing colors later requires regenerating all images, you need to choose carefully. Overlay the two images: place the hover image on top with its Visible property set to False, and the default image underneath.\nThen, place a transparent label covering the entire page background. Using the MouseMove event on the default image, set the hover image’s Visible to True on mouse over.\nFinally, use the MouseMove event on the transparent label to set the hover image’s Visible back to False when the mouse moves away.\nTake #3 # button - over\nPrivate Sub btn1_1_MouseMove(ByVal Button As Integer, ByVal Shift As Integer, ByVal X As Single, ByVal Y As Single) btn1_1.Visible = False btn1_1_2.Visible = True End Sub button - out\nPrivate Sub transparent_bg0_MouseMove(ByVal Button As Integer, ByVal Shift As Integer, ByVal X As Single, ByVal Y As Single) btn1_1.Visible = True btn1_1_2.Visible = False End Sub → original post(from my Kor blog) : https://sunnybong.tistory.com/921\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/flutter/05001/","title":"provider","section":"flutter","content":" Creating mouse hover effect in excel VBA userform # "},{"id":2,"href":"/windows_linux/06001/","title":"useful command","section":"windows, linux","content":" Creating mouse hover effect in excel VBA userform # "},{"id":3,"href":"/macrotoolkit-xls/01001/","title":"MacroToolkit - excel","section":"macrotoolkit-xls","content":" What is it? # Over the years of working extensively with Excel, I created macros for frequently used tasks. Although these were personal macros, I once shared them publicly hoping they might help others.
